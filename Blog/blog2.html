        <h2>NEGATIVE IMPACT </h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, technology can cause problems. One big issue is that spending too
          much time on phones or computers can make us feel not so good, and it's
          important to take breaks. Also, when we share a lot of personal stuff online, it
          might affect our privacy, and that can be worrying. Another thing is that not
          everyone has the same access to technology, which can make things unfair.
          Plus, there are times when we might feel a bit confused or overwhelmed
          because technology changes really fast. So, while technology is cool, we need
          to be careful and find a good balance to make sure it doesn't bring too many
          problems into our lives.

        <h2>IMPACT OF PRINTERS IN BUSINESS</h2>
        <p>Technology really changes how we live and work, especially in printing. In our
          daily lives, things get easier because we can use computers and phones. But in
          the printing business, there's a big switch. Now, we use digital printers and
          computers to copy things fast, which is good, but it means the old-fashioned
          printing ways are used less. This change is nice because it's faster, but it also
          means some jobs might change. On the good side, the new technology in
          printing helps make things look really nice with lots of colours and details. But
          not everyone can afford these new things, and small printing businesses might
          find it hard to keep up. So, even though technology brings good things, we also
          need to think about how it changes our everyday lives and work, especially in
          printing.

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p class="margin">In summary, technology is like a super helper in our world. It makes everyday
          things easier and shakes up how businesses, especially in printing, do their
          stuff. The switch to using digital printers and computers speeds things up,
          making them look even better with lots of colours and details. That's a plus!
          But, it also means some old ways of doing things aren't used as much, and that
          might change jobs. The tricky part is that not everyone can afford these new
          tools, and smaller businesses might find it tough to keep up. So, even though
          technology brings lots of good stuff, we also need to think about how it affects

          everyone. We want it to bring good things to everyone, not just a few.
          Balancing the cool things technology does with making sure everyone can
          benefit is like figuring out a puzzle for a better and fairer world.
